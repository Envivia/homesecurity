It is expected that your Jetson TX2 already has `numpy` and `opencv` installed.
Install the official tensorflow release for Jetson TX2 by following the instructions from [here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1038957/jetson-tx2/tensorflow-for-jetson-tx2-/).
You may also have to compile the MobileNet SSD model for your version of tensorflow and JetPack.
